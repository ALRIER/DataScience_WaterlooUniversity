# DtaScienceAssignments_WaterlooUniversity


Welcome to this repository, where I have compiled the different assignments I developed during my Data Science Professional Certificate program at Waterloo University for the period 2022-2023.

Here you will find assignments on introductory data science, statistics for data science, time series exercises, data structures, data reading, variable recoding, and many other examples of files I presented.

I hope they will be useful to you as an example to learn the use of data analytics in Python.

All documents are hosted on Google Colab codebooks, and the data files are stored on my Google Colab account. If you need them and want to practice, please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, and I will gladly give you access to them.

Best regards.
